<hint key="WelcomeHint">Hi, Welcome to MultiMC! To get started, simply click the new instance button in the top right and type a name to create a new instance. To start playing, simply double click the new instance's icon or right click and click play.
If you want to know what one of the buttons on the top does, simply hover your mouse over it.
There are also many useful options in the right click menu that you may want to explore. Just right click an icon to open it.</hint>

<hint key="AddModsHint">MultiMC will now open this instance's mods folder. To add mods, simply drag them into this folder. MultiMC will automatically install them the next time you run the instance, but you can tell MultiMC to install them manually by right clicking the instance and selecting rebuild.</hint>

<hint key="EditModsHint">In this menu, you can remove mods you've installed or change the order in which they will be installed. Mods near the top of the list will be installed first, whereas mods near the bottom will be installed last.
To change the install order, simply drag a mod to it's desired position.
If you would like to remove a mod, click the check box on the right side. When you click the OK button, any mods whose delete check boxes are checked will be removed.</hint>
